We use probability ampltide which have both magnitudes and a direction (phase). Probability amplitudes have two components and we often write that as complex numbers. We chose to use complex numbers rather than some other system because of the ease of manipulating the phases of complex numbers. If you plot complex number you can notice that a multiplication by $-1$ reflects across the x and y axis and a mutliplcation by $i$ rotates 90 degrees counter clockwise.

Our complex number will have a magnitude (more often called an amplitude in this context) and a phase. The magnitude is not necessarily the probability that an event will happen. The probability of an event happening is actually the square off the amplitude. That means that something that has a 50% chance of happening has a probability amplitude of $\frac{\sqrt{2}}{2}$

A complex number has two components a real portion and an imaginary portion. The state of our qubit $\psi$ can be written as a superposition between the two possible states (either a 0 or 1):

$$\vert \psi \rangle = a_0 \vert 0 \rangle +  a_1 \vert 1 \rangle $$

In the definition above $a_0$ and $a_1$ are the probability amplitudes of getting 0 and 1 respectively. While, the $\vert 0 \rangle$ refers to a qubit in the zero state and $\vert 1 \rangle a qubit in the one state. A qubit with an equal chance to be either in the 0 or 1 state would look like the following:
$$\vert \psi \rangle = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \vert 0 \rangle + \frac{1}{\sqrt{2}} \vert 1 \rangle$$
