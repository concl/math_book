**UCB Question 4.1**
<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  $\vec{u}\times \vec{v}$ can not be a scalar multiple of $vec{u}$. As previously shown the dot product $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = |\vec{u}||\vec{v}|cos(\theta)$. To be perpendicular the dot product must equal zero. However, if the cross product is a a scalar multiple of $\vec{u}$ then the angle between them is 0 making
  $cos(0) = 1$. If we assume that neither vectors are the zero vector then the dot product will always be equal to |\vec{u}||k\vec{u}| a distinctly not negative number.
