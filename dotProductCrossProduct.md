<details>
  <summary>Solution</summary>
  $\vec{u}\times \vec{v}$ can not be a scalar multiple of $vec{u}$. As previously shown the dot product $\vec{u} \cdot \vec{v} = |\vec{u}||\vec{v}|cos(\theta)$. To be perpendicular the dot product must equal zero. However, if the cross product is a a scalar multiple of $\vec{u}$ then the angle between them is 0 making
  $cos(0) = 1$. If we assume that neither vectors are the zero vector then the dot product will always be equal to $|\vec{u}||k\vec{u}|$ a distinctly not negative number.

  I'm not going to do a formal proof its kind of intuitive. If $\vec{u}$ and $\vec{v}$ are perpendicular then there is a 90 degree angle between them. That also implies that they form a right triangle and right triangles are associated with the ever famous pythagoream theorem. The theorem is written using the magitudes
  of vectors rather than simply side lengths, but regardless they are equivalent.
