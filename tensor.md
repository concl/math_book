## Vectors as Deriviatves

Most of us have dealth with parametric functions. We can take the derivaitve of the parametric curve and get a vector field representig tangent vectors at each point. Parametric curves usally involv some "universal variable" $t$ and the the function $\vec{R}(t)$ will output the curve (effectively a function that yields a positive vector).
