## Line Integrals
So far in calculus we have been used to integrating from one end point to another. In calculus one, you integrated from the lower integrand $a$ to the upper integrand $b$ in the straight line. However, we are in three dimensional space now. Lets say you wanted to integrate between the starting spot $(a,b)$ and $(c,d)$. Well that statement alone is completley ambigous. There are an infinate number of paths going to $(a,b)$ to $(c,d)$. There is the obvious straight line that connects them but its also completely valid to go in circles or in zig zags. 

A line integral involves defining some path and then integrating along that path. Integrating along the path will get you the area of everything beneath the curve. This is best shown with an image (which I did not create):

We integrated along the top pink curve and we calculated the area in accordance the amount of f(x,y) that was under said curve. A line integral is usually done with respect to arc length ($ds$) which is pretty intutive since we are integrating everything under the arc.
