# Introduction

Welcome to my online textboook. I wrote this textbook over the summer of 2023 as a rising highshool senior. I wanted to explore higher matheamatics and thought it would be cool if I kept a little online website with all of the stuff I learned. That led me to creating this online textbook. The online textbook includes content from Calculus 2, Caclulus 3, Differential equations, and more. Everything is "hand-written" by me and no writing is AI-generated. Majority of sections include thoughtful writing along with worked examples. For most the sections they also include practice problems at the end. For each practice problems I provide a solution which is either an image of my pen and paper work or full solution written in laTex. 

The textbook is far from complete and you may notice that some sections listed below aren't completley finished, however I will try my best to work on them. If you have notice any issues feel free whether that be about a typo (historically there have been a lot of laTex errors) or an incorrect solution feel free to make a pull request and I will work to fix it. 

I hope some of my knowledge can do you well and enjoy the textbook!
